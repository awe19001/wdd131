                   spend 5 to 6 hours reading per week. Spent time where it will benefit you, review code examples!</p>

                <p>Make sure you invest the time on the assignment. Work together. Do some prep work before your meeting, come ready to contribute. 
                Your teaming is critical to your progress. You will gain so much more by attending your team meetings. 
                Please do not slack off and ignore that experience. As the Mandalorian would say ‘This is the way’.
                Maybe we would say ‘This is the BYU-I way’. We learn together and share what we have learned.
                If you know it all, please share that with the team. If you don’t know anything, PLEASE share your questions because I can guarantee you, there is someone on the team meeting with the same question.</p>

                <p>Anxiety may still be climbing but it gets better.Don’t be discouraged.
                  Everyone is not at the same level in the class. Ask questions. 
                  Most concepts we are working on in this class can be demonstrated in less than 5 lines of code. 
                  Your team members can no doubt show you some simple examples. 
                  Finally, there is always prayer. If you grouped all of my prayers by topic, surely in the top <strike>ten</strike> five would be prayers about my career.
                  Right now, schooling is your career. I think your Father in Heaven has a pretty good idea about programming.
                  He did an amazing job with DNA. Let Him give you a hand. I have had numerous answers to programming prayers over the years.</p>

                <h2>Week7</h2>
                <p>You made it HALF WAY!! Your anxiety may be starting to climb at this point. Tou are halfway through the semester and you see more mountains ahead of you. Everything you have learned will be with you for the slopes ahead. Look behind you and see what you have accomplished so far in the semester. I see great examples of your code. Take a half hour and look at some of the examples from your team members and the links I have shared from others in the class. There isn’t one way to do anything, especially in programming!The simplest line of code in JavaScript can be done in 4 ways (x = x + 1; x += 1; x++; ++x;).</p>
                <p>There are arguments for using each one. (BTW go find some articles on x++, some interesting opinions on that simple line of code. Because of that I avoid it more and more). So, take some time to look at alternatives from your peers. I love the perspective I get from looking at other’s code. I use Edabit.com as an assignment in another class I teach. Once you complete a problem you can look at how others have solved it. Sometimes I think ‘well their way is wrong, mine is elegant’, other times I think ‘wow! What a cool approach’. Be open to new ideas which means you need to be out there looking at those new ideas.</p>
                <p>Let’s close with an eternal perspective. One of the underlying principles in the paragraph above may not be obvious. It is revelation. Revelation usually comes after lots of hard work and pondering.</p>
                <p><em>Doctrine and Covenants 9:7,8 Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</em></p>
                <p>Oliver’s desire was the same as yours – to understand an unknown language, not just the words but the meaning as well. <b>Invest the time, study it out and you’ll be successful </b>. I have put this to the test many times with Pascal, APL, Fortran, Jovial, Assembler, SNOBOL, C, Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL (as far as I can tell it does not work with C++, but that just might be me).</p>
                <p>God bless you. Have faith in yourself. <b>Your Father in Heaven believes in you </b>. You should as well.</p>

                <h2>Week8</h2>
                <p>First of all, there are no bad ideas. There can be bad execution. I don’t care too much what you choose to do. But I do care about the amount of creativity you put into the application and the degree to which you apply the topics you have covered. Get your application running. Make good use of JavaScript. Then get your application looking good use CSS to transition the size of input fields, change the back ground based on today’s weather or the movie you searched for. If the user entered bad or no data add a red border to the field. Just some creativity to liven up (without being obnoxious) your application. Make it pleasant to use. </p>
                <p>As we move into the second half of the class, I would encourage you to share more of your coding examples. Make sure you are able to put the coding principles to work.</p>
                <p>How is your motivation? How is your commitment to the team? How is your commitment to your education? This class is your time to learn some basics and then drill down. Explore them. Expand your understanding. Enhance the examples you were given and magnify what you can do with them.  </p>
                <p>Have some fun with your coding. If you are not having fun, you are missing the best parts.</p>

                <p>You have really made some excellent progress this semester. I know many of you have your own challenges, not of your choosing; nonetheless you have created some good examples and shown a lot of creativity. Look at the examples I have shared to get new ideas. If you see something you like copy it and make it your own! Magnify the code. Keep up the good work.  </p>
                <p>Time to get back to business. The time to be thinking about your project is past. It is now time to be actively working on it. . Plan out the last 5 weeks of the semester now. </p>

                <h2>Week10</h2>
                <p>Are you too nervous about not having enough time to develop in 3 weeks? Don’t be! You can do it. I have seen tons of projects completed in 3 weeks. The poor projects have NOT been because of lack of time but lack of effort.</p>
                <p>Be creative!!!! I do not expect an extensive application. But I expect use of the JS and CSS topics developed in this class. A simple idea is OK, but magnify that simple idea. Make your application interesting and not a throw away novelty. </p>

                <p>More tasks are elastic in nature than we might think. Give yourself a time limit. Allocate time to your priorities. Better that you do it than just let it happen. The ‘natural clock is an enemy to man’. Master your time, don’t let it master you.  </p>
                <p>Grit is a big topic lately for TED talks, pod casts and lecture circuit speakers. You have it. If you made it this far you have grit. Keep at it.</p>

                <h2>Week12</h2>
                <p>DO NOT worry about the team meeting. They are optional at this point. So just state that you attended.</p>
                <p>Sometimes when you hit a coding brick wall it can be tempting to just start throwing code against the wall to see if anything sticks. Your anxiety and frustration levels are rising and you may eventually stumble on the lines of code you need but you may not understand why they worked. The course up to this point has been based on learning principles. Stop and think about those principles and see how they apply to your coding block. Random programming is less likely to produce functioning code than principle-based analysis. – ‘precept upon precept’ Isaiah 28:10. Take this advice from someone that has hit a few coding brick walls.</p>

                <p><b>Stop and take a look behind you.</b> </p>
                <p>I know you were anxious and afraid when the course started. If you paid the price of experimenting and studying and working with your team you have come out of that darkness and like Elder Bednar mentioned in a recent talk it is a dawn of slowly growing light. So slow you might not recognize what you have walked into over the last 13 weeks.  So be proud of what you have accomplished.</p> 
                <p><b>Yes, you can do it!</b></p>
                <p>Yes, you do have time to get this all complete by the 17th of Dec. Make a deal with the family that includes ice cream or games and especially includes uninterrupted time with you. If they give you this week and next you will give them the next month.</p>
                <p>God Bless You! This is a big deal you are doing. Don't kid yourself. You are changing the rest of your life by getting your education and quite likely changing your children's lives as well.</p>
